# AI Brand Lab – Second Life

## 🚀 Project Overview
AI Brand Lab is a solo project focused on building AI-powered bots inside Second Life. These bots help new players by answering common questions using Reddit and Second Life community data. I'm also developing companion AIs that users can interact with and purchase through the marketplace — creating a new type of virtual business.

## 🧠 Technical Stack
- Mistral-7B with LoRA adapters
- FP16 mode for 12GB RAM optimization
- Modal GPU compute (A100 preferred)
- Data sources: Reddit threads, SL forums, player FAQs

## 🎯 Goals
- Improve onboarding for new Second Life players
- Build and sell customizable AI companions
- Share open-source workflows for low-cost training/inference
- Demonstrate how AI can power virtual economies

## 💡 Status
Currently testing workflows on Colab and RunPod. Seeking GPU credits via Modal to scale training and deploy bots reliably in-world.
